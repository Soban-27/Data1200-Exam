            <p> The automated tests we used were Lighthouse and validator.w3. After intensively testing the text, we found out that there were some wasted elements that were not in use (see pictures provided below). The thing we understood was that the problems we encountered were due to not minimizing the space that had gaps. After testing, we got a solid score, but eventually, we understood that there were some key elements we still had to change. We had to minimize the gaps because unless we did that, the coding would not be structural, and someone else could not try to improve. We did an internal check between us, where we went and changed these errors.

        <div class="acc-box"> <!-- Box3 -->
            <p> Another problem we encountered was the fact that the images were not scaled properly to each other. Therefore, it looked weird when adjusting the website to smaller screens. The test reported this to us too. Hence, we went and changed the sizing to be optimized. On the pictures, you can see the test warning us about this error.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>All this can be validated by the fact that the website goes for a clean design. It is built as accessible as possible; hence, someone else can easily access the project from where we left off.</p>

        <div class="acc-box"> <!-- Box5 -->
            <p> Moving on, another problem we had was the contrast of the colors on the website. When we first began, we wanted to use a lot of colors, but since that made the website really messy, we decided against it. Therefore, we opted for the clean look instead of the colorful. That's why we used colors like black, white, and gray. You can also see in the test below that they also told us that using, for example, gray text would be too low contrast.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>   Some of the choices we took were, for example, using a background image on all of the pages. We did this because this gives off a professional look and is used widely. For example, tesla.com and samsung.com use a similar design. We also used the grid as the primary format of the way we designed the website because this gave the design the most pleasant look.</p>
